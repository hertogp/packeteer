# Packeteer

Helper library to make encoding/decoding binaries easier.

This is yet another library to aid in the development of custom binary
encoder/decoders.  Other work on this front include:
- [bitcraft](https://hexdocs.pm/bitcraft/Bitcraft.html)
- [bifrost](https://hexdocs.pm/bifrost/Bifrost.html)
- [bin_format](https://hexdocs.pm/bin_format/extra-api-reference.html)
- [codec](https://hexdocs.pm/codec/api-reference.html)


## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `packeteer` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir

```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
